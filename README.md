**Boids Algorithm**
This is a simple implementation of the boids algorithm. It spawns a collection of agents (boids) in a circle around 0, 0, 1000, and sends them towards 1500, 1500, 1500. They then bounce back and forth between the two locations.
Due to their flat spawn positions, they don't have much vertical movement in their flock.
For some reason, they have a small amount of vertical velocity upwards. I'm not sure why this is, nothing gives them vertical velocity, they just drift upwards.
